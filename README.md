## Who am I?

👋 Hi, I’m @jasperquak. I am from The Netherlands, engineer by background, and working in software development for 20+ years. While having coded in my earlier years, since long I have been working in roles such as Business consultant, Application architect, UX designer and Product manager.

🌱 I’m currently learning new skills though: I am learning Data Analytics and Data Science in Python with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). This includes doing hands-on data projects, both 'guided projects' and independent projects. A selection of these projects is posted here on Github.
